# Simple Flex Grid

Easy-to-use grid based on Flexbox in pure CSS.

## Why will it be useful to me?

If you are implementing a website with a simple responsive layout, using [Bootstrap] or other frameworks can be time loss with unuseful CSS, or make you import more that you need.

Simple Flex Grid provides you a CSS grid layout.

1. It is in pure CSS
2. It is small
3. It doesn't change your fonts
4. It doesn't change your colors
5. It is simple
6. It is flex
7. And it is nothing else than a grid

## Notes

Breakpoints are based on [Vuetify], while `container` class width is based on [Bootstrap]
